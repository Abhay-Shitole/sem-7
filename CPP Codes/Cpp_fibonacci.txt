/* What is Fibonacci Series?

The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

F(n)=F(n−1)+F(n−2)

with

F(0)=0,F(1)=1

So, the series goes:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, …

2️⃣ How to Compute Fibonacci Numbers

There are two main ways:

Recursive method – directly implements the mathematical definition.

Iterative method – uses a loop (faster and less memory).

We’ll use the iterative method, since it’s easy to trace step count.

3️⃣ Step Count Analysis

Let’s define step count as the number of basic operations (like additions and assignments) executed by the algorithm.

For each loop iteration, we:

perform 1 addition (a + b)

perform 2 assignments (a = b, b = next)

So, 3 steps per iteration approximately.
If there are n iterations → Total Steps ≈ 3n */
